\title{The distribution of gene lengths was calculated from gff/gtf.}
\usage{
calculate_geneLength(
  filepath,
  format = "gff",
  type = "genes",
  bin = 500,
  threshold = 4000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{Input GFF3 or GTF file. Can be a path to a file, or an URL, or a connection object, or a GFF3File or GTFFile object.}

\item{format}{Format of the input file. Accepted values are: "auto" (the default) for auto-detection of the format, "gff3", or "gtf". Use "gff3" or "gtf" only if auto-detection failed.}

\item{type}{Counting "gene"" (the default) length or "transcript" length.}

\item{bin}{Length of sliding window. Default is 500}

\item{threshold}{Genes exceeding the threshold length were collapsed together and counted. Default is 4000}
}
\value{
Eventually, return a data frame describing the distribution of gene lengths under a sliding window.
